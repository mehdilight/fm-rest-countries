## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vuejs.org/) - Build tool


### Notes

Some of the things we can improve in this project is caching the response. in order to reduce API requests. also the error handling, in case if the request fails we should show to the users a meaningful alert.


### Useful resources

- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - this library used to handle client side routing.
- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) - This is an amazing collection composable utilities, I used it to handle dark mode toggle.
